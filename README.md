Project Name: Facebook Engagement Predictor

Description:

This project uses ML.NET to build a machine learning model that predicts the sentiment of Facebook comments, classifying them as either positive or negative.
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled Facebook comments and uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text of each comment.

Features:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation using ML.NET
- Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques
- Prediction of positive or negative sentiment for new, unseen comments

Goals:

- Achieve high accuracy in sentiment prediction
- Develop a scalable and deployable model
- Provide insights into Facebook user engagement and sentiment

Technologies:

- ML.NET
- C#
- NLP libraries (e.g. Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Language.TextAnalytics)

Dataset:

- A labeled dataset of Facebook comments (e.g. Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Getting Started:

- Clone the repository
- Install required NuGet packages
- Run the data preprocessing script
- Train and evaluate the model
- Use the model to make predictions on new comments

Contributing:

- Bug fixes and improvements to the model and codebase
- Addition of new features and functionality
- Expansion to other social media platforms
